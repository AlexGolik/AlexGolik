**AlexGolik/AlexGolik** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a technology enthusiast with a strong interest in developing myself as an expert in cybersecurity, backend development, and software architecture. Although I am currently in a learning stage, I am committed to acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in these fields.
