### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**AlexGolik/AlexGolik** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a technology enthusiast with a strong interest in developing myself as an expert in cybersecurity, backend development, and software architecture. Although I am currently in a learning stage, I am committed to acquiring the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in these fields.

My previous experience, including my work as a Junior Consultant at McGraw Hill and my role as a Support Analyst for the Azteca campaign at Group COS, has provided me with a solid foundation in data analysis, operations, and technical support. I am determined to leverage these skills to build a career in backend development and software architecture, where I plan to specialize in creating secure, robust, and highly efficient applications.

Furthermore, I have undertaken freelance work in hardware and software maintenance and support, allowing me to develop a practical understanding of technological infrastructure and the significance of cybersecurity in today's environment.

I am committed to continuous learning and actively studying the latest trends in cybersecurity, backend development, and software architecture. My goal is to collaborate with cybersecurity and development teams to ensure that applications and systems are resilient to cyber threats and are designed efficiently and effectively.

I am excited about the opportunity to grow in these areas and contribute to information protection and the design of advanced technological systems in the future."
